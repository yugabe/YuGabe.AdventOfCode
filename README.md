# YuGabe.AdventOfCode

This is my personal repo where I store the solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

My solutions use my own runner/framework you can find at `[Tidy.AdventOfCode](https://github.com/yugabe/Tidy.AdventOfCode)`. You can also see how I "cheat", because I'm not using the publicly available NuGet package. Instead, I directly cloned the Tidy repo as a submodule and simply added a project reference to it. You can do the same if you like, but be aware that you'll have to manually pull the changes from the remote instead of updating the NuGet package (via whatever convenient means you prefer, like Visual Studio's NuGet Package Manager or the CLI tools). It has the added benefit that you can modify the code in the framework if you so desire.

## Private leaderboard

You can join my private (ha!) [leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard/private) with the code `262120-78a0e92f` if you like. I'm not overly competitive with regards to timing, as I'm unable to start the puzzles when they go live, but we can check each others' progress.
